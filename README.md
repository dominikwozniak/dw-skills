Plans and reviews land on disk under `.ai/` (tracked in git), so work survives a `/clear`, a new
session, or a handoff to another agent. Every skill reads your project's own commands and
conventions — nothing about a stack is baked in.

## ◆ Why these skills exist

These aren't theoretical. Each is a failure mode I kept hitting in day-to-day work with AI agents —
the catalog is the set of reusable steps I pulled out of that loop. Each skill kills one:

- **Context dies on /clear or a handoff** — plans and reviews persist as tracked `.ai/` files;
  `dw-resume` picks the work back up, `dw-handoff` packs it for the next agent.
- **The agent runs on a wrong assumption** — `dw-spec` forces the unknowns to the surface as a
  numbered Open-Questions gate and HARD STOPS until you answer.
- **"Done" is claimed but never proven** — `dw-explain` writes runnable scenarios; `dw-verify` runs
  them and never reports PASS without captured output.
- **The plan silently drifts from the code** — `dw-sync` re-aligns `PLAN.md` with what actually shipped.
- **A change merges on an eyeball, not a real pass** — `dw-review` / `dw-conform` / `dw-risk` weigh it
  across axes, against the repo's own patterns, and for blast radius.
- **Review findings have nowhere to land** — `dw-fix` applies them: the one writer in the quality
  pipeline, severity-gated (blockers first), one commit per fix.
- **The test suite bloats** — `dw-prune` trims redundant tests without dropping coverage.

The _why_ behind each design choice is in [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md).

## ▸ Quick start

Codex (all 17 skills in one plugin):

```
codex plugin marketplace add dominikwozniak/dw-skills
codex plugin add dw-skills@dw-skills
```

Start a new Codex task after installation. Invoke explicitly with `$dw-spec` in CLI/IDE, or select
`dw-skills` in the app and ask to use `dw-spec`.

Claude Code (three selective packages):

```
claude plugin marketplace add git@github.com:dominikwozniak/dw-skills.git
claude plugin install dw-planning   # spec → plan → build → resume → sync
claude plugin install dw-quality    # review · conform · fix · prune · explain · verify · risk
claude plugin install dw-misc       # bootstrap · git · handoff · doctor · setup-precommit
```

Then start a feature: `/dw-spec`. Resume after a `/clear`: `/dw-resume`.

| Surface             | Support                      | Package shape                          | Hook setup                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Codex CLI, IDE, app | macOS, Linux/WSL; CLI ≥0.122 | one `dw-skills` plugin                 | opt-in via `dw-bootstrap --platform codex`  |
| Claude Code         | existing supported hosts     | `dw-planning`, `dw-quality`, `dw-misc` | opt-in via `dw-bootstrap --platform claude` |

Codex cloud and native Windows are outside v1. Codex `.env` hooks are best-effort, not a security
boundary, because every built-in read is not interceptable.

## ↻ The workflow

> 📖 New here? [**`docs/WORKFLOWS.md`**](docs/WORKFLOWS.md) is the guided tour — the loop
> walked step by step, a recipe for each situation (start a feature, resume after a
> `/clear`, review before a PR, fix findings, reconcile drift), and the decisions between
> skills. The map below; that's the tour.

### The core loop

```
  SPEC         PLAN         BUILD                   REVIEW · VERIFY           SHIP
  /dw-spec  →  /dw-plan  →  /dw-build       →       /dw-review  /dw-explain → (open PR — your own tooling)
                          ↺ /dw-resume (pick up)    /dw-conform /dw-verify
                            /dw-sync (fix drift)    /dw-prune   /dw-risk
  └────────────── .ai/runs/<id>/ ──────────────┘    └─ .ai/verify/<branch-slug>/ ─┘
```

`<branch-slug>` = the current branch slugified, e.g. `ABC-123/password-reset` →
`abc-123-password-reset`. SHIP — deciding when to open the PR, plus the deploy/CI that follows — is
intentionally outside this toolkit (see [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md), "Composable, not
chained").

### Acting on findings

`/dw-fix` is the one writer in the loop — it applies the `dw-review` / `dw-conform` / `dw-risk`
findings the auditors record (blockers first, one commit per fix), then you re-audit to confirm —
required after blockers, optional after a medium/low-only pass.

### Anytime

- `/dw-git` — commit / push / PR / sync / branch / stash, by your `CLAUDE.local.md` conventions.
- `/dw-handoff` — compact the session context for the next agent.

### Setup (once per repo)

- `/dw-bootstrap` — scaffold a repo for this loop (tracked `.ai/` + `.claude/`).
- `/dw-doctor` — read-only health check of the tools and hooks the loop assumes.
- `/dw-setup-precommit` — wire git-level husky + lint-staged pre-commit hooks.

A recommendation, not a rail: every skill stands alone and is invoked when you need it. They
compose through the shared `.ai/` artifacts + a "Next:" pointer at the end of each skill.

## ◇ Task router — which skill for which task

A task may match several rows — read all that apply. `⭑` = explicit-invoke only: say its name (it
never auto-fires).

Within Review & verify: `dw-explain → dw-verify` is a chain (verify runs explain's scenarios);
`dw-review` and `dw-conform` are independent axes; `dw-prune` trims redundant tests on explicit
consent; `dw-risk` reads whatever neighbours exist and closes the pipeline. `dw-fix` is the one
writer — it applies the findings the auditors record (blockers first), then you re-audit to confirm
(required after blockers, optional after a medium/low-only pass).

## ▣ Packages

Codex installs the root `dw-skills` plugin with all 17 skills and real `skills/` plus
`scripts/runtime/` payload. Claude keeps three job-focused packages:

- **`dw-planning`** — the spec→plan→build loop. `dw-spec` · `dw-resume` · `dw-plan` · `dw-build` ·
  `dw-sync`. Artifacts: `.ai/runs/<id>/`.
- **`dw-quality`** — the change-quality pipeline. `dw-review` · `dw-conform` · `dw-fix` · `dw-prune` ·
  `dw-explain` · `dw-verify` · `dw-risk`. The auditors diagnose (read-only); `dw-fix` is the one
  writer. Artifacts: `.ai/verify/<branch-slug>/`.
- **`dw-misc`** — repo setup + everyday helpers. `dw-bootstrap` · `dw-git` · `dw-handoff` ·
  `dw-doctor` · `dw-setup-precommit`.

## ⚙ How it works — the design in one screen

Full design rationale — the _why_ behind each choice — lives in [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md).

- **Persistence in the skill, not a wrapper.** Each `SKILL.md` writes its own `.ai/` paths as part of
  its procedure, so plans land automatically and travel with the installed plugin — no
  `.claude/commands/` glue layer. (Stack commands are read from your project too — nothing is
  hardcoded; that's the opening pitch up top.)
- **`.ai/` is tracked, one folder per task, no central index.** Artifacts are real work docs
  committed with the code; each run is matched to its git branch, so branches never fight over one file.
- **Thin harness, fat skills.** The process lives in the markdown, not in glue code — so every model
  upgrade improves the skills for free. Bulky detail (templates, examples) loads on demand from
  `references/`. (Inspired by ["Fat Skills"](https://x.com/garrytan/status/2042925773300908103).)
- **Composable, not chained.** Skills stay separate and link through shared `.ai/` artifacts + a
  "Next:" pointer — a recommendation, never a forced sequence. Why there's no autonomous loop closing
  this is in [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md), "Loops vs persistence."
- **Explicit-only skills** (`dw-bootstrap`, `dw-handoff`, `dw-prune`, `dw-sync`, `dw-setup-precommit`)
  are invoked by name and never auto-trigger; the rest can be model-invoked when the task fits.

### Migrating an old Codex install

Remove empty legacy Codex installs named `dw-misc`, `dw-planning`, or `dw-quality`, add this
marketplace again, and install `dw-skills@dw-skills`. Start a new task so Codex reloads the catalog.

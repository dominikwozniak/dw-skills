# 🧩 dominikwozniak-skills

**A persistent, technology-agnostic spec → plan → build → verify workflow for Claude Code — as
installable skills.**

Plans and reviews land on disk under `.ai/` (tracked in git), so work survives a `/clear`, a new
session, or a handoff to another agent. Every skill reads your project's own commands and
conventions — nothing about a stack is baked in.

## 😖 Why these skills exist

These aren't theoretical. Each is a failure mode I kept hitting in day-to-day work with AI agents —
the catalog is the set of reusable steps I pulled out of that loop. Each skill kills one:

- **Context dies on `/clear`, a new session, or a handoff** → plans and reviews persist as tracked
  `.ai/` files; `dw-resume` picks the work back up, `dw-handoff` packs it for the next agent.
- **The agent runs on a wrong assumption** → `dw-spec` forces the unknowns to the surface as a
  numbered Open-Questions gate and HARD STOPS until you answer.
- **"Done" is claimed but never proven** → `dw-explain` writes runnable scenarios; `dw-verify` runs
  them and never reports PASS without captured output.
- **The plan silently drifts from the code** → `dw-sync` re-aligns `PLAN.md` with what actually shipped.
- **A change merges on an eyeball, not a real pass** → `dw-review` / `dw-conform` / `dw-risk` weigh it
  across axes, against the repo's own patterns, and for blast radius.
- **The test suite bloats** → `dw-prune` trims redundant tests without dropping coverage.

The _why_ behind each design choice is in [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md).

## 🚀 Quick start

```
claude plugin marketplace add git@github.com:dominikwozniak/dominikwozniak-skills.git
claude plugin install dw-planning   # spec → plan → build → resume → sync
claude plugin install dw-quality    # review · conform · prune · explain · verify · risk
claude plugin install dw-misc       # bootstrap · git · handoff · doctor · setup-precommit
```

Then start a feature: `/dw-spec`. Resume after a `/clear`: `/dw-resume`.

## 🔁 The workflow

```
  SPEC         PLAN         BUILD                   REVIEW · VERIFY           SHIP
  /dw-spec  →  /dw-plan  →  /dw-build       →       /dw-review  /dw-explain → (open PR — your own tooling)
                          ↺ /dw-resume (pick up)    /dw-conform /dw-verify
                            /dw-sync (fix drift)    /dw-prune   /dw-risk
  └────────────── .ai/runs/<id>/ ──────────────┘    └─ .ai/verify/<branch-slug>/ ─┘

  Setup: /dw-bootstrap (scaffold a repo) · /dw-doctor (env health check) · /dw-setup-precommit (wire git pre-commit hooks)
  /dw-git — commit / push / PR by your conventions, at any point.
  /dw-handoff — compact context for the next agent, at any point.
```

`<branch-slug>` = the current branch slugified, e.g. `ABC-123/password-reset` →
`abc-123-password-reset`. SHIP — deciding when to open the PR, plus the deploy/CI that follows — is
intentionally outside this toolkit (see [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md), "Composable, not
chained"); `dw-git` runs the git mechanics (commit / push / PR) by your conventions when you ask.

A recommendation, not a rail: every skill stands alone and is invoked when you need it. They
compose through the shared `.ai/` artifacts + a "Next:" pointer at the end of each skill.

## 🧭 Task router — which skill for which task

A task may match several rows — read all that apply. `⭑` = explicit-invoke only: say its name (it
never auto-fires).

Within Review & verify: `dw-explain → dw-verify` is a chain (verify runs explain's scenarios);
`dw-review` and `dw-conform` are independent axes; `dw-prune` trims redundant tests on explicit
consent; `dw-risk` reads whatever neighbours exist and closes the pipeline.

## 📦 Plugins (install what you need)

- **`dw-planning`** — `dw-spec` · `dw-resume` · `dw-plan` · `dw-build` · `dw-sync`. The persistent
  spec→plan→build loop; artifacts under `.ai/runs/<id>/`.
- **`dw-quality`** — `dw-review` · `dw-conform` · `dw-prune` · `dw-explain` · `dw-verify` ·
  `dw-risk`. A change-quality pipeline writing to `.ai/verify/<branch-slug>/`.
- **`dw-misc`** — `dw-bootstrap` · `dw-git` · `dw-handoff` · `dw-doctor` · `dw-setup-precommit`, plus
  a bucket for future cross-cutting helpers. `dw-bootstrap` scaffolds a repo for this whole loop
  (tracked `.ai/` + `.claude/`); `dw-git` runs git ops by your `CLAUDE.local.md` conventions;
  `dw-doctor` is a read-only check that the tools and hooks the loop assumes are actually present;
  `dw-setup-precommit` wires git-level husky + lint-staged hooks (team-shared, distinct from the
  session-only `.claude/hooks/*.sh`).

## 🛠️ How it works

- **Persistence in the skill, not a wrapper.** Each `SKILL.md` bakes its `.ai/` paths in, so plans
  land automatically and travel with the installed plugin — no `.claude/commands/` glue.
- **`.ai/` is tracked, one folder per task, no central index.** Artifacts are real work docs
  committed with the code; runs are matched to the current git branch (no merge-conflict magnet).
- **Technology-agnostic.** Skills are pure procedures; test/lint/run commands and the commit
  convention are read _from the project_ (a declared `## Commands` block → manifests → the code),
  never hardcoded.
- **Thin harness, fat skills.** A skill's weight tracks its procedure; bulky detail (templates,
  taxonomies, stack examples) lives in `references/`, loaded on demand.
- **Composable, not chained.** Skills stay separate (different axes) and link through shared `.ai/`
  artifacts + a "Next:" pointer — a recommendation, never a forced sequence. Why there's no
  autonomous loop closing this — and where a bounded one would fit — is in
  [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md), "Loops vs persistence."
- **Explicit-only skills** (`dw-bootstrap`, `dw-handoff`, `dw-prune`, `dw-sync`, `dw-setup-precommit`)
  are invoked by name and never auto-trigger; the rest can be model-invoked when the task fits.
